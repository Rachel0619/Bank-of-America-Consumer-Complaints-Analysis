By analyzing which attribute are more likely to impact the result mentioned above, those related companies can then better target the key segment to tackle the problem of complaints.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Category 1: Category Analysis**
- **Category 2: Company Analysis** 
- **Category 3: Demographical Analysis**

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)

# Developer Guide

I used docker container to run my analysis. To replicate the workflow, run the following steps:

Make sure your docker daemon is running before starting.

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

run `docker ps` to make sure that container for postgres and pgadmin are running, then navigate to 'localhost:8080' to open pgadmin GUI and login using the environment variable stored in `.env` file.

run `data_loading_csv.py` to load data into postgres database.
