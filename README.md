By analyzing which attribute are more likely to impact the result mentioned above, those related companies can then better target the key segment to tackle the problem of complaints.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Category 1: Product Analysis**
- **Category 2: Issue Analysis**
- **Category 3: Company Analysis** 
- **Category 4: Demographical Analysis**

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

1. High Volume of Mortgage Complaints: Mortgage products account for over a third of all complaints, significantly outpacing other financial products such as debt collection and credit reporting. The most common sub-products within mortgages include other mortgage types, conventional fixed mortgages, and adjustable-rate mortgages.
2. Top Issues Leading to Complaints: The most prevalent issues causing complaints include loan modifications, collection, foreclosure, and incorrect information on credit reports. Sub-issues such as account status and debt ownership disputes are particularly frequent, highlighting specific pain points for consumers.
3. Major Companies Receiving Complaints: Large financial institutions, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan Chase, consistently receive the highest number of complaints. The distribution of complaints by state indicates a recurring pattern, with mortgage products often being the most problematic across various regions.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)

# Developer Guide

I used docker container to run my analysis. To replicate the workflow, run the following steps:

Make sure your docker daemon is running before starting.

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

run `docker ps` to make sure that container for postgres and pgadmin are running, then navigate to 'localhost:8080' to open pgadmin GUI and login using the environment variable stored in `.env` file.

run `data_loading_csv.py` to load data into postgres database.
