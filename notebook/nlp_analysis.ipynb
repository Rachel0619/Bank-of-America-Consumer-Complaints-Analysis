I am unaware of anyone else relieving the BofA of my funds at the time. I called to have the hold lifted, by phone to no avail. I then made numerous attempts both by phone and by entering the local BofA. Each time I was unable to straighten this out. The people from the bank would not help at all. They wanted the payee to come in. I showed a police report of a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He is not capable of leaving the place, because he is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and he has XXXX which i was told by his dr that he will never leave where he is because of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. So now, not only he can't travel, but neither can he XXXX. Recently had a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. After numerous attempts to withdraw my funds, I am about to lose my vehicle ( impounded ) nor am I able to pay rent, utilities, non food items, etc. so on XX/XX/XXXX, I entered the bank to demand they give me my money, then was told I had XXXX in my account. It should have been $ XXXX. When requesting to see last 10 transactions, the teller refused and despite being told of my brother 's demise. Instead of assisting me, they give away my money. This is blatant discrimination. I have no money, i am XXXX and XXXX. They are costing me my car. They need to pay for this mis treatment. I'll find out their names, only if they be reprimanded for how XXXX being treated. I hope they feel the impact that I feel. Filed complaint earlier threw you guys that was closed because you guys said they responded to me but have not received anything from them want to reopen case get something done for me please\n"
